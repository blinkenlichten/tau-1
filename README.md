# Almost empty playground

## car_irc_gps_logger - will eventually be an IRC GPS coordinates logger for a car.
A simple Rust program, that is in development (maybe won't be never useful).
It's intend is to connect to hardcoded IRC server address to post some GPS coordinates into some channel.
The idea is to be able to make a home-made car tracker that won't force one to lease a VPS,
that is an overkill for such thing, but instead the car logs the coordinates via some public IRC server,
and the mobile app. client will grab that data using some simple Android IRC client, too.
